#Function to perform selection

if this is your first selection generation:
    set the categories()

if this is not your first selection generation:
    promote the animals ()


1) #SET THE CATEGORIES
#FEMALE SELECTION
#age 0: select female calves
female_calves = animals_age_0(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 1: select females for breeding
breeding_females = animals_age_1(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 2: select cows remaining after 1st lactation
cows2 = animals_age_2(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 3: select cows remaining after 2st lactation
cows3 = animals_age_3(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 4: select cows remaining after 3st lactation
cows4 = animals_age_4(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 5: select cows remaining after 4st lactation
cows3 = animals_age_5(sex = "female", number = XX)
#continue this for a given number of lactations

#age XX: select bull dams
#select top females from a given set of cows at a given age


#MALE SELECTION
#age 0: select males from elite matings for performance testing
male_candidates = animals_age_o(sex = "male", number = XX)
#age 1: select top males for progeny testins
young_bulls = animals_age_1 (sex = "male", number = XX)
#age 2: select top males in progeny testing
young_bulls = animals_age_2(sex = "male", number = XX)
#age 3: select top males in progeny testing
young_bulls = animals_age_3(sex = "male", number = XX)
#age 4: select top males in progeny testing
young_bulls = animals_age_4(sex = "male", number = XX)
#Do this for however logn your progeny testing lasts
#age 5: select progeny tested males from CHOSEN years (thid depends on how long a bull is used for in your population)
elite_bulls = animals_age_5(sex = "male", number = XX)
elite_bulls = animals_age_6(sex = "male", number = XX)
elite_bulls = animals_age_7(sex = "male", number = XX)
elite_bulls = animals_age_8(sex = "male", number = XX)


#INSEMINATION
#cows with elite bulls + young bulls
#bull dams with elite bulls
#create newborns

#PROMOTE THE ANIMALS
#here you do the same as above, except you choose from previous years categories
female_calves = select_from_previous_year_newborns(sex = "female", number = xx)
#age 1: select females for breeding
breeding_females = select_from_previous_years_female_calves(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 2: select cows remaining after 1st lactation
cows2 = select_from_previous_years_breeding_females(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 3: select cows remaining after 2st lactation
cows3 = select_from_previous_years_cows2(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 4: select cows remaining after 3st lactation
cows4 = select_from_previous_years_cows3(sex = "female", number = XX)
#age 5: select cows remaining after 4st lactation
cows3 = select_from_previous_years_cows4(sex = "female", number = XX)
#continue this for a given number of lactations

#age XX: select bull dams
#select top females from a given set of cows at a given age

#MALE SELECTION
#age 0: select males from elite matings for performance testing

#age 1: select top males for progeny testins

#age 4: select top males in progeny testing
young_bulls4 = promote_previous_years_young_bulls3(sex = "male", number = XX)
#Do this for however logn your progeny testing lasts
#age 5: select progeny tested males from CHOSEN years (thid depends on how long a bull is used for in your population)
elite_bulls5 = select_from_young_bulls4(sex = "male", number = XX)
